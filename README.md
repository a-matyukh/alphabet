Sometimes in recent years, I feel some problems with concentration: I can’t not think about anything for 2 minutes or focus on one thought or activity for a long time. In fixing concentration among different methods and exercises, the “Alphabet” game from the New Code NLP helps me, which allows, in addition to concentration, to enter an HPS-state similar to the "flow"-state.

The essence of the game is that you need to say the letter and raise those hands that are shown on the card.

I made a small prototype of this game, which, in addition to the basic functionality, can add simple gamification, counting the correct answers using hand tracking and perceiving voice.

The work on prototyping the idea itself took about one working day thanks to the wonderful SvelteKit and handtrack.js.

The speech recognizer often does not quite correctly recognize the desired letter: not quite correct pronunciation may affect, in the console you can see what exactly the speech recognizer hears.
The hand detection model also does not always work perfectly: you need good lighting.

Good game and concentration! :)
